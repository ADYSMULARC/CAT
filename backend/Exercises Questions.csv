Question ,Week,Day,Exercise
"In the Retail Gasoline exercise, we have projected the gasoline prices for the next 15 years by using the past gasoline prices and Autofill function. How exactly did Excel project the future gasoline prices?",1,8,Retail Gasoline
"In the Alex Processing exercise, why is it that we cannot merely project the number of equipment holding using past equipment holding and Autofill?",1,10,Alex Processing
"In the Alex Processing exercise, we used the TREND() function and past 10 years productivity to forecast the next 10 years' productivity of the machines. Why is it that we did not include the forecasted 11th year productivity when we forecast for the 12th year productivity?",1,12,Alex Processing
"In the Alex Processing exercise, we managed to forecast the next 10 years' productivity using linear trend provided by the TREND() function. Is this realistic? If not, how would you modify the approach?",1,14,Alex Processing
"In the F1 Night City Race exercise, the influence diagram allows us to picture the connection from the Profit (performance measure) to the Room Rate (input). The Other Revenue was assumed to be a fixed input parameter forming part of the Total Revenue. However, it is possible that Other Revenue is not a fixed value. How would you modify the influence diagram? ",2,15,F1 Night City Race
"In the F1 Night City Race exercise, we only considered the Room Revenue in our final model. If there is Other Revenue associated with each room sold, how would you modify the model?",2,16,F1 Night City Race
"In the F1 Night City Race exercise, the Trade-Off Analysis Profit curve displayed a quadratic relationship giving us two break-even Room Rates. If you were the hotel manager, which Room Rate would you choose to break-even, and why?",2,17,F1 Night City Race
"In the F1 Night City Race exercise, the price-demand sensitivity curves (lines) were constructed based on Room Occupancy increase/decrease based on decrease/increase of Room Rate. In real business situation, how would one obtain such price-demand sensitivity data?",2,18,F1 Night City Race
"In the F1 Night City Race exercise, we used Solver to determine the best room rate to set by maximizing the profit. However, if we choose to maximize the profit margin instead, the best room rate will be a different answer. Why?",2,19,F1 Night City Race
"In the F1 Night City Race exercise, we performed Sensitivity Analysis and observed that at room rates higher than $400, the profit can vary over a very large range as the room rate increases. How can one use this information in decision making for the hotel business during the F1 season?",2,20,F1 Night City Race
"In the Village Coffee exercise, net profit is computed for different coffee prices and different number of months of upkeep. We highlighted regions where maximum net profits can be achieved. When coffee price is $0.95, we obtained the same net profit of $10,000 for zero month of upkeep and one month of upkeep. Which decision would you choose and why?",2,21,Village Coffee
Both PV() and NPV() functions compute the present value of cash flows. When do I use which function and what are the differences?,3,22,Time Value
"In the Time Value exercise, we completed five small examples to compute the PMT, PV, FV, Rate and Nper, knowing 3 or 4 of the others. When do we use Goal Seek to determine the answer we want?",3,24,Time Value
"In the Time Value exercise, we computed the NPV for a series of cash flows for a given return rate. Suppose I want the NPV to be a certain value, how can I determine the return rate that can give me the desired NPV?",3,25,Time Value
"In the Time Value exercise, we computed the future value of $100 for different number of years and different return rate/year, using the 2-variable Data Table. I wonder how did the Data Table work?",3,27,Time Value
"There are two types of Data Table, the 1-variable Data Table where the variable values can be a row or column, and 2-variable Data Table where the 2 variables should have one listed across the row and the other listed down a column and both should meet at the intersection. With such setup restrictions, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using 1-variable versus 2-variable Data Table?",3 or 4,28,
"There are many LOOKUP functions, including LOOKUP(), VLOOKUP(), MATCH() and INDEX(). What are their differences and how do I know when do I use which function to be most appropriate?",4,29,
"In the Echo Office Supplies exercise, we tried to compute the unit price and total charge for different number of widgets using LOOKUP() and VLOOKUP() function. However, before we do that, we need to convert the range values (e.g. 1 to 200) into numbers. Why do we need to do so? And how do I know if the number should be the upper or lower limit of the range?",4,30,Echo Office Supplies
"In the Echo Office Supplies exercise, we used Solver to determine the new prices for three products at six quantity ranges, to maximize total sales or minimize total percentage drop in sales. Examine the percentage drop in prices and sales for all the customers and describe what you see (use Model sheet).",4,31,Echo Office Supplies
"In the Echo Office Supplies exercise, we used MATCH() within INDEX() to fetch the entire row of corresponding values for a selected customer, using array formula (hitting CTRL-SHFT-ENTER). Can you think of other array formulas?",4,32,Echo Office Supplies
"In the CCH Kindergarten exercise, we retrieved the Code (in column D) corresponding to the selected Category (in column E) using INDEX() and MATCH() functions. The formula used contains an IF() statement, e.g. D6 = IF(E6="""","""",INDEX(… MATCH(…))). What are the advantages and disadvantages of using the IF() statement like this?",4,32,CCH Kindergarten
"In the CCH Kindergarten exercise, we used SUMIF() to sum the total expenses according to different codes. The criteria for the SUMIF() was entered as text string using the & sign given as ""=""&M6 where M6 contains the code. Is the ""=""& really needed? If not, then when will this be needed?",4,33,CCH Kindergarten
"In the CCH Kindergarten exercise, we sum the total expenses for all months from Jan to Dec in the YTD sheet. For example, E7 = SUM(Jan:Dec!O7) which sums all the values in cell O7 for all sheets from Jan to Dec. How did this work? Can I just add new sheets, say Mar, Apr, May and so on and it will still work?",4,34,CCH Kindergarten
What is the difference between NORMDIST() and NORMSDIST()? When do I use which?,4 or 5,35,
"If I were to use RAND() and RANDBETWEEN(0,1), and I understand that both are uniform distribution between 0 and 1. Will the randomly generated results be the same or different?",5,36,
"In the Monte Hall exercise, we determine the door to reveal after the contestant has chosen the door, by using a 3x3 matrix. What if the game has 4 doors now, can you work out the matrix?",5,37,Monte Hall
"In the Monte Hall exercise, we determine the door which the contestant can change to, after one door has been revealed, using the second 3x3 matrix. What if the game has 4 doors now, can you work out the matrix?",5,37,Monte Hall
"In the Monte Hall exercise, there is a Random Door column added in column I. What is the purpose of this Random Door column?",5,38,Monte Hall
"In the Monte Hall exercise, we computed the probability of winning to be 1/3 for Change Door, and 2/3 for Same Door. What if the game has 4 doors now, what would be probability of winning?",5,38,Monte Hall
"In the Data Sim exercise, we learnt three different methods to simulate more data points, including (1) Using Frequency Bins, (2) Using Re-sampling, and (3) Using Inverse Distribution. When do I use which method?",5,39,Data Sim
"In the Data Sim exercise, we computed the CRF for different outcomes and then used either the LOOKUP() or VLOOKUP() function to generate the next random outcome by comparing a RAND() number with the CRF. Why do we need to shift the selection of the CRF to exclude 1.0 in the formula?",5,40,Data Sim
"In the Data Sim exercise, we used Re-sampling (method 2) to simulate a new data. For discrete data, we used the SMALL() function. Will it work if I use the LARGE() function instead? And why?",5,41,Data Sim
What is the difference between NORMINV() and NORMSINV()? When do I use which?,5,42,Data Sim
How do I compute the duration between a start time (A) to an end time (B) in seconds?,6,43,
"In the XDB Bank exercise, we computed the average inter-arrival time to be the duration between the first and last card-in time and divide by 50. Shouldn't we divide by 49 since there are 49 intervals for 50 customers?",6,44,XDB Bank
"In the XDB Bank exercise, we simulated the interarrival time (column C) using inversion of Exponential distribution. Why is it that we can do so instead of using PERCENTILE() to re-sample, like in service time simulation (column D)?",6,45,XDB Bank
"In the XDB Bank exercise, Results sheet, we used a 2-variable Data Table to tabulate the wait time for 15 simulations for each setting of different number of servers from 1 to 8, and then computed the grand average. From the results, what will be the optimal number of servers and why? How can this results be applied to a restaurant or a food stand and what are the business implications?",6,46,XDB Bank
"In the XDB Bank exercise, we developed the c-Server model to represent 1 queue with multiple servers. If a real business has c queues with c servers, how would you modify the model?",6,47,XDB Bank
